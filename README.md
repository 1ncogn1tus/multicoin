Multicoin Wallet
===============

I like Coinomi wallet (https://coinomi.com) but this application exists only for mobile devices.
This project is attempt to port my favorite cryptocurrency wallet to desktop.

This application using Java and compatible for all desktop platform.

## Building the app

Make sure that you have JDK 7 installed before building. You can use ant to build jar.

## Run app

java -jar multicoin.jar

When application will run first time, file "wallet.dat" will be created in current directory. Don't loose this file. 
Also you must store mnemonic code what will be generated at first launch. 
With mnemonic code you can restore your wallet when you lost wallet.dat file or forgot wallet password
