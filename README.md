I like Coinomi wallet (https://coinomi.com) but this application exists only for mobile devices.
This project is attempt to port my favorite cryptocurrency wallet to desktop.

This application using Java and compatible for all desktop platform.

This software is not stable now. Do NOT USE it for real money.
